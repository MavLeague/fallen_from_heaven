# Fallen From Heaven
This Datapack stops you from dying in the Void. Instead when you e.g. fall into the Void in the End Dimension you'll end up high above the World Spawn.

## Function
### End --> Overworld
When falling in the Void, you'll be teleportet into the Overworld. Your Location will be at the **World Spawn** at **y=258**.

### Overworld --> Nether
When falling in the Void, you'll be teleportet into the Nether. Your Location will be **x/8 y=258 z/8**.
