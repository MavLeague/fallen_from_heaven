# Fallen From Heaven
This Datapack stops you from dying in the Void. Instead when you e.g. fall into the Void in the End Dimension you'll end up high above the World Spawn.

## Function
### End --> Overworld
When falling in the Void, you'll be teleportet into the Overworld. Your Location will be at the **World Spawn** at **y=258**.

### Overworld --> Nether
When falling in the Void, you'll be teleportet into the Nether. Your Location will be **x/8 y=258 z/8**.

## Update! Added config menu
- It's now possible to configure how the pack behaves.
- This is managed with a data storage which stores the config.

### Edit Config:
```

### Configureable Settings

**end_use_spawn:** When falling into the Void of the End Dimension, you'll end up high above the worldspawn. When disabled, the coordinates will stay the same.

**skyblock_mode:** When falling into the Void, you'll come down far in the sky in the same dimension.
